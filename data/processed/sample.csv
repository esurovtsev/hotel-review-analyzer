However, for the dollars, there is a SUBSTANTIALLY better alternative just two blocks away. 
We stayed just one night (having been unsuccessful in extending our stay at the Embassy Suites due to a triathlon). We found the room to be clean, comfortable, and the view almost incomparable. The front desk personnel were professional and pleasant, although seemingly somewhat detached. 
We had a room on the 48th floor facing the WTC site. It was quite small, with scant extra room for anything other than the bed, desk and chairs. We ultimately ended up putting some of our luggage on the air-conditioner in front of the window. 
This hotel does NOT offer complimentary internet access to it's Diamond members, does NOT have a complimentary breakfast or happy hour, and certainly does not have an all-suite layout. Compared to the Embassy Suites (which, coincidentally was $18 less per night) there is no way this property could earn the highest marks. 
Perhaps most alarmingly, we received a call in our room (although we were out and it was on voicemail) in which we were requested BY NAME to return a call to someone's NYC cell phone number. This was shocking since we knew NO ONE in NYC, and furthermore, we had told no one that we were moving to the Millenium. When we called the number, we were told that the call had been a ""mistake"". 
There are some positives: The subway station is literally right outside the door, and the views are phenomenal. 
Overall, I would return ONLY if my hotel of choice were unavailable.","{'username': 'Boeing767', 'num_cities': 90, 'num_helpful_votes': 377, 'num_reviews': 143, 'num_type_reviews': 134, 'id': 'A5F51BA3CCAD57D198DD905A05A70430', 'location': 'Ewa Beach, Hawaii'}",2007-07-01,262330,7,2007-07-23,8224640,False,3.0

However, upon our arrival, we were quite underwhelmed.
Although some people might have liked the room decorations, we thought the hotel seemed quite antiquated. Also, the room service menu did not have much variety, and our meals were late a couple of times. The staff was not as friendly as we could of liked, as there were a couple of times we called the concierge for requests and got very delayed responses, if we got responses at all. Once, we asked for headache medicine, and when it finally arrived (30 minutes later), we later found out that they charged us for it. I would have been better off going to the local pharmacy! We also felt rushed by the hotel to check out by receiving numerous calls. 
The best thing about the hotel was the location, as it was convenient to many of the local sites in San Diego, and very close to one of the main shopping centers. 
Overall, we were quite disappointed in the hotel, and probably would not stay again. If you enjoy the retro atmosphere, it may be ok, otherwise, we would not recommend staying here.","{'username': 'oasisheikh', 'num_reviews': 1, 'id': 'C976D6F4F02A130B1DF160DED51975C7', 'location': 'Fairfax, Virginia', 'num_helpful_votes': 6}",2007-07-01,80590,6,2007-09-16,8723772,False,2.0

A lot of positive things about this place. We had a very warm welcome. Helpful staff. The hotel's location is good: very near the Golden gate bridge, and there are a couple of bus lines a block away getting you to key parts of the city simply and cheaply.The room was not huge by any means, but was clean and well furnished with phone and TV. We were pleased to find a well-equipped kitchen with microwave, kettle, cooker and coffee and chocolate provided. Parking was provided.
However, though there was a second block of rooms overlooking a pretty rear courtyard with flowers, the rest (about 8) overlook the busy main road below. This was the case for us, it was extremely noisy to the point where, when trucks passed, you could feel the whole place vibrate! The windows shut out some of the noise but, being of the old design, should probably be changed to provide better acoustic isolation. Likewise, the curtains were pretty feeble and let in light. Had there been vacancies, I would definitely have asked to change rooms, but the whole place was booked up. We only stayed a couple of nights so just lived with it, but we didn't get a good night's sleep!
Ironically, the kitchen and bathroom areas looked out over the rear yard and were quiet - they should renovate the rooms and put the sleeping part at the back!
Overall, a recommendable place but only if you get a rear room.","{'username': 'romko r', 'num_cities': 7, 'num_helpful_votes': 8, 'num_reviews': 7, 'num_type_reviews': 6, 'id': 'BE0933709C6E68B95A23F76459CED180', 'location': 'Madrid, Spain'}",2011-09-01,82116,5,2011-09-28,118692445,False,3.0

I read the reviews ahead of time, so I was pretty prepared...and experienced most of the problems others have. The elevators are SLOW...God forbid you are on the 18th floor or above, there is only one bank of three (VERY SLOW) elevators, and we OFTEN spent ten minutes waiting. The room was clean, nothing impressive, neither horrible nor wonderful. The minibar was disconnected, but locked, so you couldn't use the fridge anyway (would it really kill them to let you? Oh, wait...you could rent a fridge for $30/day!) There was bottled water in the room if you wanted to pay FOUR DOLLARS A BOTTLE for it. The service for the conference was rather poor...coffee and hot water for tea were often out, dishes were left sitting, etc. The Downtown Cafe food was ok, overpriced, as would be expected, but DON'T sit outside...right under the El, and so loud! Also, they have a ""beer tower"" drink, which is literally a giant tower of beer. As one can imagine, it is popular with your stereotypical wannabe frat boys, who also like to sit on the patio and dispense shots into the mouth of whoever walks by...while the staff looks on (even though there are regulations in Chicago against alcohol leaving the marked premises). The service was polite enough but slow, and when you're at a conference, promptness is important (especially when you'll be spending the next five years waiting for an elevator!) Overall, the lobby is OK (in Europe no one would look twice), but you could come in and peek at that if you wanted to. I was happy with the security, they did ask to see our room keys when we came in at night (but would it be that hard to get/find one?) which is better than most hotels, the concierge was very little help when asked a simple question, the staff was ok, oddly enough, the most friendly were the housekeepers and the bell staff, we were allowed to check in early which was helpful, but if I was paying to stay here, I wouldn't have been impressed. Basically...just ok, with enough annoyances to make it worthwhile to look elsewhere.","{'username': 'Alli_1119', 'num_reviews': 2, 'id': '9CC81965F889453693230D194EB2023F', 'location': 'Wisconsin', 'num_helpful_votes': 13}",2006-08-01,111501,7,2006-09-19,5816588,False,2.0

Due to the fact it's mainly a business hotel they mostly shut down over the holiday season. The resturants in the hotel and room service closed at lunch time and there is not many places near by to eat. We ended up eating at Union Station at night, however I didn't feel overly safe walking back to the hotel at night, even with my brother. 
I would stay here again the rooms were great and the location was fantastic but the fact there wasn't much in the way of food or markets around made it a little hard.","{'username': '', 'id': '', 'location': ''}",2004-12-01,84129,5,2005-01-05,2979501,False,3.0

Dans le prolongement de Pine Street se dresse l'élégante Nob Hill, accessible par les fameux cable cars, qui passent juste devant l'hôtel et vous conduisent Downtown. 
L'hôtel est logé dans un batîment des années 70 sans grâce particulière, de 26 étages.
Les chambres Corner King Superior View Guest Room, situées dans les étages supérieurs de l’hôtel, sont de taille moyenne mais offrent une très belle vue panoramique sur la baie de San Francisco, nappée en matinée de la fameuse brume chère à Hitchcock. Décorées de façon très traditionnelle sinon datée, elles disposent de lits très confortables et proposent un accès wifi Internet gratuit. Les salles de bains ont une baignoire de petite taille un peu désuète. Malgré l'âge des installations, l’ensemble est propre et bien maintenu.
Le petit déjeuner, copieux et de qualité, est servi par un personnel avenant et efficace, dans une salle sans lumière naturelle manquant de charme.
L’hôtel dispose d’une piscine extérieure de taille généreuse, autour de laquelle il est agréable de prendre un bain de soleil. Rappelez vous cependant que la température en été à San Francisco peut être fraîche.
Le personnel de l’hôtel est charmant et dévoué, et contribue largement au charme de l’hôtel, pourtant sans grâce particulière.
En résumé, par son emplacement à proximité des principales attractions de la ville et dans un quartier gentiment underground, l’hôtel Holiday Inn San Francisco Golden Gateway constitue une bonne base pour découvrir la ville, à condition de ne pas être trop exigeant sur la décoration intérieure et la taille des chambres.
Quelques conseils :
- Ne manquez pas de visiter le magnifique SFMoMa Center, logé dans un bâtiment de l'architecte Mario Botta. Il s’agit de l'un des meilleurs musées d'art moderne et contemporain au monde, avec une magnifique et très riche collection permanente.
- A deux pas du SFMoMa Center se trouve South Park, petite place au charme européen où florissent les start-up high tech, les restaurants et les bars les plus en vue de la ville.","{'username': 'Nicolas_from_Paris', 'num_cities': 57, 'num_helpful_votes': 424, 'num_reviews': 75, 'num_type_reviews': 75, 'id': '955C3EB1CD2607A8B66AD11A91F3B90B', 'location': 'Paris, France'}",2006-08-01,81049,5,2007-10-11,10068463,False,3.0

the next day they moved us to a king bed room, next to the garbage shoot that stank like stale garbage!
because of the inconvenience, the manager offered us $50 off the first night fee. When it came time to pay, the manager said she did not recall our conversation about offering us this discount!! Again, what HORRIBLE customer service!

{'overall': 3.0},“Glitzy lobby but everything else pretty basic”,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights recently with my husband. We had a room on the 20th floor facing the front of the hotel. Initially we were assigned to a room 2 floors below but it was so dark and drab in there given the price were paying, I knew that they could do better. Our stay was just okay. The worst part about the room is that the walls are pretty thin, we could hear everything that was going on with our neighbours next door including a nasty fight they were having at 2 o'clock one morning. The room was spacious by NYC standards but the bathroom was woefully inadequate with very little if any place to store our toilettries and it was a hit and miss in terms of getting hot water in the shower. We did not eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel so I cannot comment. The location of the hotel is first class and that is probably its best feature. I definetly do not think this hotel is value for money when paying full price, and the only way I would stay there again is if I copped a deal on Priceline.","{'username': 'Valerie G', 'num_cities': 6, 'num_helpful_votes': 14, 'num_reviews': 22, 'num_type_reviews': 10, 'id': '26EF02E555F4723D57E9722857C4A8E1', 'location': 'Tortola, British Virgin Islands'}",2005-09-01,93450,7,2005-10-06,3996870,False,3.0

- Location: Despite what some have said, the location's actually great. A couple of blocks east of Michigan Ave./west of Navy pier, on the Chicago River and next door to the NBC Tower.
- Great view from my room (11th floor, looking west along river and Wacker Drive).
- Friendliness of Staff
- Predictability of large chain hotel: Ease of check-in, check-out; several restaurant options inside hotel; attractive common areas in hotel, etc.
- Very good rate ($79 per night excl. tax) for my stay, booked via Starwood website. At that rate, I would be inclined to stay again.
...and a few negatives:
- The charge for use of hotel's workout facility. $10 per day. However, they do offer a $15 for your entire stay option.
- The restaurants offer rather standard and bland fare and are overly priced. (Plenty of better options in the neighborhood...I recommend Boardman's Urban Kitchen in the NBC Tower for breakfast).
- Some of the furniture in the rooms and the carpeting in the halls were worn and in need of replacement.
- I had the world's smallest hotel TV in my room (a 19 or 20 inch Zenith).
- Lots of familes and kids in the hotel, so if you're a business traveler, a couple w/out kids or a single leisure traveler, this probably isn't the hotel for you.","{'username': '', 'id': '', 'location': ''}",2005-03-01,87638,6,2005-03-28,3307957,False,3.0
